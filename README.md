Welcome to my GitHub profile! I hold a BSc in Biotechnology and a Post Graduate Programme in Data Analytics and Data Science. My journey through these fields has fueled my passion for merging biology with data science, uncovering meaningful insights, and solving complex problems through data-driven approaches.

In my repositories, you'll find a variety of projects showcasing my skills in Python, R, and SQL, along with tools like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn,and matplotlib. From data analysis and visualization to machine learning and statistical analysis, I enjoy exploring the endless possibilities that data science offers.

I'm always eager to learn new technologies and collaborate on exciting projects. If you share similar interests or have any questions, feel free to  drop me an email. Let's build something amazing together!
